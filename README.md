#### Using APIs to Visualize Weather Data

SITUATION/TASK:  Analyzing weather data for a travel tech company.
The company is attempting to provide real-time information to clients via their search page which they would filter based on their preferred travel criteria to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. 

APPROACH: Retrieving data from a web Application Programming Interface (API) because of its practicality and efficiency versus getting data directly from a website. Using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CityPy, Python Requests, APIs and JSON Traversals to collect weather data from over 500 cities all over the world, parse the JSON data and then store it in a data frame. We analyze the data using Pandas and plot the data using the matplotlib library and google maps API, then we perform a statistical analysis with the SciPy library. 

RESULTS: Series of plots that visually and statistically show the relationship between a latitude and a variety of weather parameters.

SOFTWARE/SKILLS USED: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib,Pandas Library, CityPy, Python Requests, APIs, SciPy Statistics and JSON Traversals
